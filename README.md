# Compression-Project
An implementation of a compression/decompression algorithm using [lz77](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LZ77_and_LZ78) and [huffman coding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huffman_coding).

### How to run:

1. Open the terminal
2. Set the current directory to the one where compress.py/decompress.py are located.
3. To compress a file type:
   '''
   python3 compress.py <InputFileName.txt> <OutputFileName.txt>
   '''
   To decompress a file type:
   '''
   python3 compress.py <InputFileName.txt> <OutputFileName.txt>
   '''
4. The compressed/ decompressed file will be stored as OutputFileName.txt in the same directory.
